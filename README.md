# Vending Machine API

The Vending Machine API is a sophisticated TypeScript and Node.js project, built to showcase advanced development concepts including Test-Driven Development (TDD), Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and the application of design patterns for efficient test case generation. The project aims to provide a robust, reliable, and maintainable solution for a complex problem in the domain of automated retail management.

## Overview

This project is designed to simulate a vending machine with a RESTful API, allowing users with a "seller" role to add, update, or remove products, while users with a "buyer" role can deposit coins and make purchases. The system ensures proper access control, handles user authentication, and provides a web interface for interaction with the API.

The Vending Machine API is structured to be a practical example of the application of various software engineering best practices and principles, including:

- Utilizing TDD to ensure code reliability and maintainability
- Employing OOP for modular, scalable, and reusable code
- Implementing design patterns to optimize test case generation and coverage
- Applying SOLID principles to create clean, organized, and adaptable code

## Features

The Vending Machine API provides the following functionalities:

- User authentication with role-based access control
- CRUD operations for users and products
- Deposit functionality for buyers, with coin value validation
- Purchase functionality for buyers, including change calculation
- Reset functionality for buyers to clear their deposit balance
- Active session conflict handling and session termination

## Tech Stack

The project leverages the following technologies:

- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- React (for the web interface)
- SQL Database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL)
- Jest (for testing)
